# MART-441-HW-3

The functions and variables confused me initially but after viewing the examples provided it didn't take long to pick it up. I feel like there are more 
advanced techniques to learn with them and that when the time comes I will be prepared. What I did fall short on this week was the "onclick". I wanted to replace the image with each click to provide a better setting for each description. Unfortunately after six continious hours of attempting to make this code work I ran out
of time. Perhaps next week as I work more on this project I'll be able to find the answer to how to make this work. Though it may require logging on during your visiting hours to see how you would do it. Overall, I am satisfied with the work this week, though I still think I can do better.
